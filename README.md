# Game List

## Introduction
I'm making this as an assignment for practicing how to make Model View Controllers. It's (at least for now) a small list of some games I've enjoyed.

## How to use
- Dotnet run
- Follow instructions in the terminal to add, remove, update and view the games in the list.

### It's a work in progress, I'm still testing what I can and can't do and I haven't added all the functions I need, so it will not work yet!
