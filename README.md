# Game List

## Introduction

I'm making this as an assignment for practicing how to make Model View Controllers. It's (at least for now) a small list of some games I've enjoyed.

## How to use

- Dotnet run
- Follow instructions in the terminal to add, remove, update and view the games in the list.

### It's a work in progress, but it should work properly now. I'm currently lokking into how to better write MVC code, so I might make some changes to it later
